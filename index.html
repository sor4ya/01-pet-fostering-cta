      <h3>Why Foster a Pet?</h3>
      <p>
        Fostering gives pets a safe, loving home while they wait for adoption. It helps them adjust to family life, improves their chances of being adopted, and makes space in shelters for more animals in need. Even a short time in your care can change a pet's life forever!
